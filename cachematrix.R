##makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special “matrix” object that can cache its inverse.
##Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R. 
##For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse

##The purpose of these functions are to cache the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly.
##The first function, makeCacheMatrix, creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse, which is list to do the following:
##set the value of the vector
##get the value of the vector
##set the value of the mean
##get the value of the mean

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
          x <<- y
          i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() i
  list(set = set, get = get, setinverse = setinverse, getinverse = getinverse)
}

##This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
##If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
##then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  i <- x$getinverse()
  if (!is.null(i)) {
          message("getting cached data")
          return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(i)
  i
}

## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
